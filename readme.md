This repository covers some projects I've worked on over the course of learning HTML/CSS/JS.
Here's what each of the files do:
**algorithmExperimentation1.html** - A little experimentation with rectangles on Canvas, sine, and cosine.
**BalloonAnimation.html** - I'm not really sure how I can explain this one. I went through a little stick figure obsession phase, so I guess this was my sick sense of humor expressing itself.
**colorfulCircle.html** - Again, another test with Canvas, rectangles, animation, and circles.
**confetti.html** - Another experiment with Canvas incorporating simple mouse movements.
**DNA.html** - I worked on this project by far the hardest. This simulates a DNA strand. It starts with a random sequence and you can modify it by clicking on the different objects(you can't modify the sugars and phosphates, because otherwise it's not DNA). Then you can download that as a file and likewise import it next time you run the DNA simulator.
**fallingSnow.html** - **confetti.html** without the mouse movements.
**ParticleMotionSimulation.html** - Simulates particle motion in water with a slider to change the gravity and speed.
**rainbowLoader.html** - I also had a little obsession with trying not to use JS and making loaders, so I combined that and made a rainbow loader for my little sister.
**slopeField.html** - When I was learning Calculus, I incorporated the graph parts. This incorporates a slope field(and you can modify the function it makes a slope field on line 66).
**TF-IDF.html** - Performs TF-IDF(term frequency-inverse document frequency) on a folder of text files. Basically, it can find the important topics and words in text.
